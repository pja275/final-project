##FINAL PROJECT 

<p>For my final project I was interested in pursuing and furthering developing the CSS Animations assignment. I really enjoyed working with SVG graphics and creating interesting visual displays that changed upon user interaction. I enjoy art in general and enjoy drawing and illustrations. I like to work closely with abstract visuals, patterns and textiles. Ideally, I want to create a series of pages that connect each other visually, if not visually, conceptually so there is an underlying concept. I’m still struggling with the kind of theme/intended goal (even if just for aesthetics), but I want to create a certain continuity and flow to the pages, so it makes it easy for the user to understand the flow. I also wanted to hide links within the interactivity, so it is up to the user to find the link to the next page, and instills curiosity in the user. </p>
<p>For the CSS Animation I created 5 rings in Illustrator and had them rotate in opposite directions, and they would change upon interactions (either grow, or change color…). I want to continue working with this by adding more rings, so that it takes up the whole browser window, and add more effects when hovering over each ring. My idea is to overwhelm the audience with visuals, and other sensory elements. Only one ring would link to the following page and it would be the user’s job to find that link. </p>
